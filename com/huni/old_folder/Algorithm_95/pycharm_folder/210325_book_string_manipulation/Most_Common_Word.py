# Input: paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.", banned = ["hit"]
# Output: "ball"
# Explanation:
# "hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
# "ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph.
# Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
# that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"),
# and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
